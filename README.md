### Signing up:
Go to the AoC site (![adventofcode.com]), sign up, and go to the "Leaderboard" tab. Click on "Private Leaderboard" and enter the _Join-Code_ that is provided in the WhatsApp group.
The scores are determined by the amount of stars ðŸŒŸ each player gets. A tie is broken by the least amount of time that a player got the recent star.

### Uploading code
In order to organize our code, please upload your code in to a folder with your username. Open a folder for each day, in which you should have three files:
_input.txt, answer.txt, solution.*_ where: _input.txt_ has your specific puzzle input, _solution.*_ is your code for solving the puzzle in language of your choice, _answer.txt_ is the result of executing _solution.*_ on _input.txt_. 

### Notes:

* Of course, you can join the fun and solve puzzels without entering the contest. You don't have to upload your code and neither to join the AoC leaderboard.
* The winners will be determined based on the AoC leaderboard.
* Beautiful and creative solutions would be acknowledged and shared so everyone could learn from them.
