# ðŸ”¥ Prisma coding challange! ðŸ”¥
Based on Advent of Code 2021,


### Signing up:
Go to the AoC site **adventofcode.com**, sign up, and go to the "Leaderboard" tab. Click on "Private Leaderboard" and enter the following _Join-Code_: "1525364-55967b56".  
The scores are determined by the amount of stars ðŸŒŸ each player gets. A tie is broken by the least amount of time that a player got the recent star.

### Uploading code
In order to organize our code, please upload your code **to a folder with the coresponding day**:  
Open a folder with your username, in which you should have 5 files:
_input.txt, answer_part1.txt, answer_part2.txt, solution_part1.*, solution_part2.*_ where: _input.txt_ has your specific puzzle input, _solution*_ is your code for solving the puzzle in language of your choice, _answer*_ is the result of executing _solution*_ on _input.txt_.  

Create a branch with your solution and a PR and I will authorize it.
### Notes:

* Of course, you can join the fun and solve puzzels without entering the contest. You don't have to upload your code and neither to join the AoC leaderboard.
* The winners will be determined based on the AoC leaderboard.
* Beautiful and creative solutions would be acknowledged and shared so everyone could learn from them.
